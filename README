###Build
Lucy depends on gtk+-3.0, libssl, libnotify and libzip. Install them before building lucy.

In apt-get based system (like Ubuntu). You can install the dependencies using following command:

		sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libssl-dev libzip-dev libnotify-dev

In other system (like Fedora), package name should be similar.

Try to build lucy and run.

		./configure
		make
		./lucy

Please let me know, if you have problem building or running lucy.
